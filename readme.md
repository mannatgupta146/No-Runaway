## How It Works  

1️⃣ The page displays a **fun, lighthearted message** along with "Yes" and "No" buttons.  
2️⃣ When the user hovers over the **"No" button**, it **jumps to a random position** on the screen.  
3️⃣ Clicking **"Yes"** triggers a **delightful response** (or maybe an unexpected surprise 😉).  
4️⃣ The background features a **smooth, animated gradient**, enhancing the aesthetic feel.  
5️⃣ The entire layout is **mobile-friendly**, ensuring a seamless experience on any device.  

💡 **Pro Tip:** Try getting someone to click "No"—watch them struggle! 😆
